LeanAttention is a scalable and energy-efficient technique of computing self-attention for ragged batching scenarios and the token-generation phase (decode-phase) of decoder-only transformer models. By extending the "stream-K" style reduction of tiled calculation to self-attention, we enable parallel computation with well-balanced loads during attention, resulting in an average of 2.6x attention execution speedup over FlashAttention-2 and up to 8.33x speedup for 512k context lengths.
